          <h4>1. What is Building Information Modeling (BIM)?</h4>
          <p>
            Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a digital representation of a
            construction project's physical and functional characteristics. It
            enables architects, engineers, and construction professionals to
            plan, design, construct, and manage buildings and infrastructure
            more efficiently.

          <p>
            BIM improves project coordination, reduces errors, and enhances
            communication among stakeholders. It leads to better
            decision-making, cost savings, and faster project completion.
