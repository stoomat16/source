            <h2>What is Construction Administration?</h2>
            <p>
              Construction Administration is the crucial phase that bridges
              the gap between project design and actual construction. It
              involves project coordination, quality control, budget
              management, and on-site supervision to bring the design vision
              to life. This phase is where the rubber meets the road, and the
              success of your project depends on efficient and knowledgeable
              administration.
